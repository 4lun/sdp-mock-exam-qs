## SDP mock questions
A repo with attempted answers to the mock questions, and with Unit Tests (JUnit 5, hipsters) to validate them.
Mock questions are here: http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~keith/sdp/resources/exams/sample.pdf

Feel free to add comments in Issues or branches.

## How-To
I use Gradle, as
1) intellij is evil,
2) I don't want syntax-highlighting while I am attempting exam conditions.

## Run tests (Linux/OSX):
./gradlew test

## Run tests (windows):
./gradlew.bat test
